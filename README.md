# SimpleBinaryTree
A simple binary tree in python, no class and objects i use dicts!
The special thing about this script is that we aren't using any classes nor objects, just dicts!

# Note
You are free to use this code, note that at the moment this script doesn't have any user input and it contains only a "create node" function.
If you want to add the stuff that we need (see the "to do" section of this readme" then open a pull request! Thank you!

# To do:
-"delete node" function
-"modify node's value" function
-User input
-Print a graphical text-only map of the binary tree
