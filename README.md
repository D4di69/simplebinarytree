# SimpleBinaryTree
A simple binary tree in python, no class and objects i use dicts! <br />
The special thing about this script is that we aren't using any classes nor objects, just dicts!

# Note
You are free to use this code (unlicense), note that at the moment this script doesn't have any user input and it contains only a "create node" function. <br />
If you want to add the stuff that we need (see the "to do" section of this readme" then open a pull request! Thank you! 

# Node identifier
The node identifier is: parent identifier + position <br />
Position: 0 = Root, 1 = Left, 2 = Right

# To do:
-"delete node" function <br />
-"modify node's value" function <br />
-User input <br />
-Print a graphical text-only map of the binary tree <br />
-Info about the tree's length and depth
